Computational Finance and Data Analytics Portfolio
 Overview

This repository contains my 7 major finance-related Python projects, showcasing how programming, statistics, and financial concepts can be combined for real-world analysis and decision-making.
Each project focuses on a different domain of finance — from risk management and portfolio optimization to business performance analytics.

Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to:

Apply financial theories through Python-based implementation

Perform data analysis, visualization, and modeling

Solve real-world financial problems using quantitative and analytical tools

 Projects Included

Market Risk Analysis of Tesla Stock (Historical & Monte Carlo VaR)
→ Estimated Value-at-Risk and Conditional VaR for Tesla using simulation techniques.

Investment Decision (Financial Calculator using Python)
→ Built a calculator to compute NPV, IRR, and Payback Period for project evaluation.

Options Data Analysis for AAPL
→ Analyzed options chain data to calculate Put/Call Ratio, Max Pain, and visualize Implied Volatility.

Portfolio Optimization (Pakistani Companies)
→ Applied Modern Portfolio Theory to build an efficient portfolio maximizing the Sharpe Ratio.

Credit Risk Modeling
→ Compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict loan default risk.

Monte Carlo Simulation for Value-at-Risk
→ Simulated portfolio returns to estimate market risk using probabilistic methods.

Business Performance Dashboard
→ Created an interactive dashboard to visualize company performance metrics using Power BI / Python.
